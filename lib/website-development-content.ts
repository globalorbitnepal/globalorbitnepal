    q: "How much does website development cost in Nepal?",
    a: "Cost depends on pages, design, features, and integrations. Starter packages are listed on our Packages pages from NPR 15,000 for simple sites; larger builds are quoted after a brief discovery call.",
  },
  {
    q: "How long does it take to build a professional website?",
    a: "Many business sites ship in roughly six to ten weeks after scope approval — design, build, content, SEO pass, and launch. Complex e-commerce or applications take longer; we estimate per project.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you provide custom website design?",
    a: "Yes. Every client receives art direction and layouts created for their brand, not a copy of our homepage.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can you redesign my existing website?",
    a: "Yes. We plan redirects, preserve valuable URLs where possible, and stage migrations with Search Console monitoring. Rankings are never guaranteed.",
  },
  {
    q: "Will my website work on mobile phones and tablets?",
    a: "Yes. Responsive layouts are standard. We test representative phone and tablet widths before launch.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can you build an e-commerce website?",
    a: "Yes — WooCommerce, Shopify, or custom cart flows depending on catalogue size and operations.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you develop hotel and trekking websites?",
    a: "Yes. Hospitality and adventure travel are core verticals — see our hotel and trekking landing pages and portfolio.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can you integrate online payments?",
    a: "Yes when gateways such as Stripe, eSewa, or Khalti are in scope. Integration work is documented in your quote.",
  },
  {
    q: "Will my website be SEO-friendly?",
    a: "We implement technical SEO foundations — metadata, headings, sitemaps, canonical URLs, and performance budgets. Rankings depend on competition and ongoing content; we do not promise page-one positions.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can you migrate my existing website without unnecessary ranking losses?",
    a: "We use redirect maps and staged cutovers to reduce risk. Search engines ultimately control indexing; we monitor and adjust after launch.",
  },
  {
    q: "Will I be able to update website content myself?",
    a: "Yes when a CMS is included. We train your team on the editor you will use day to day.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you provide website maintenance and support?",
    a: "Yes — monthly care plans cover updates, backups, security patches, and small content changes when agreed.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can you integrate third-party booking or business systems?",
    a: "Yes when APIs and credentials are available. Scope defines which systems connect in phase one versus later.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you provide domain registration and hosting assistance?",
    a: "We advise on DNS, hosting, and SSL setup and can manage deployment on infrastructure you own or we provision per contract.",
  },
  {
    q: "What information should I prepare before requesting a quotation?",
    a: "Brand assets, example sites you like, page list, languages, integrations, and target launch window help us quote accurately.",
