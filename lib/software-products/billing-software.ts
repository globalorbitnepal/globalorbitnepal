      "Most growing businesses outgrow handwritten bills and shared Excel files at the same moment: a customer asks for a corrected invoice, a supplier statement does not match your notebook, or month-end takes three days because payments live in a different tab than sales.",
      "A billing system gives every invoice a number, every customer a balance, and every payment a reference back to the bill it clears. Staff stop retyping product names. Managers see outstanding receivables without calling the cashier. Owners get summaries that match what was actually issued — not what someone remembers from yesterday.",

    {
      q: "Is this billing software suitable for small retail shops in Nepal?",
      a: "Yes. We configure tax lines, products, and receipt layouts for single-counter shops and scale to multi-branch wholesale when you need it.",
    },
    {
      q: "Does it support VAT or GST invoices?",
      a: "The system supports structured tax lines and document types used in Nepal and other markets. Your accountant should confirm labels and reports match your registration before go-live.",
    },
    {
      q: "Can I manage both sales and purchase invoices?",
      a: "Yes. Sales, purchases, credit notes, and payment allocation live in one workspace so receivables and payables are visible together.",

    {
      q: "Is inventory required?",
      a: "No. Many service businesses use billing without stock. Inventory-linked billing is available when you enable the warehouse or POS modules.",

    {
      q: "Can multiple users bill at the same time?",
      a: "Yes, with unique logins. Invoice numbering and permissions are handled server-side to reduce collisions.",

      q: "Can I print invoices for walk-in customers?",
      a: "Yes. PDF and printer layouts include your branding and line detail. Hardware drivers depend on your local printers.",

      q: "How do migrations from Excel work?",
      a: "We import customers and products when spreadsheets are consistent, then enter opening balances in a controlled checklist with finance sign-off.",

      q: "Is there a mobile view?",
      a: "The web application is responsive for phones and tablets. Native mobile apps are a separate scope if you need offline counter mode.",
